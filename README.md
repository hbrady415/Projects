For this project I created a text based blackjack game from scratch in java complete with doubling down, splitting and all typical blackjack features.  Project was intended to
experiment with classes very early on in my programming career.  Simulates a casino, the player enters with $100 and can play until they run out.  The main idea for the project 
play around with creating a deck of cards and shuffling it without any 3rd party libraries and the blackjack was just an expansion on that idea.
