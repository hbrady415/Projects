For this project I created a text based blackjack game from scratch in java complete with doubling down, splitting and all typical blackjack features.  Built a Deck class of Card objects which creates a fully working and shuffling deck of 52 Card objects.  Simulates a casino, the player enters with $100 and can play until they run out.  The main idea for the project was to play around with creating a deck of cards and shuffling it without any 3rd party libraries and the blackjack was just an expansion on that idea.
